# Fitness Goal Tracker

## Project Introduction

The Fitness Goal Tracker is a web application designed to help users track and achieve their fitness goals effectively. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can set, monitor, and update their fitness objectives, such as weight loss, strength building, and distance running. The application allows users to register an account, log in, and access their personalized dashboard to view their current fitness goals.

## Features Developed

1. **User Registration and Login**: Users can create an account with their credentials and log in to access their fitness goals.

2. **User Dashboard**: Once logged in, users can view their current fitness goals on their personalized dashboard.

3. **Setting Fitness Goals**: Users can set fitness goals by specifying the type of goal (e.g., weight loss, reps, distance) and the target metrics.

4. **Displaying Fitness Goals**: The dashboard displays all fitness goals, along with their corresponding target metrics.

5. **Updating Fitness Goals**: Users can update their fitness goals, such as changing the target weight or reps.

6. **Session Management**: The application uses session management to keep users authenticated during their session.

7. **MongoDB Database**: The application uses MongoDB as the database to store user information and fitness goals.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- ORM: Mongoose
- Session Management: express-session
- AJAX: Fetch API

## Challenges Faced

1. **User Authentication**: Implementing a secure user authentication system was a significant challenge. We had to ensure that only authenticated users could access their dashboard.

2. **Database Integration**: Integrating MongoDB and Mongoose with the application was challenging due to the learning curve associated with working with a NoSQL database.

3. **Dynamic Rendering**: Dynamically rendering fitness goals on the dashboard required careful manipulation of the DOM to display the goals in an organized manner.

## Final Outcome

The final outcome of the Fitness Goal Tracker is a functional web application that allows users to track their fitness goals effectively. Users can register, log in, set fitness goals, and view their progress on their personalized dashboard. The application successfully stores user data in a MongoDB database and retrieves it as needed.

## Practical Usage

The Fitness Goal Tracker is designed to be a practical tool for individuals who wish to monitor their fitness progress and achieve their health goals. Users can utilize this application to set realistic fitness objectives, track their progress over time, and make necessary adjustments to their workout routines or diet plans.

With the user-friendly interface and intuitive design, the application caters to users of all fitness levels, helping them stay motivated and focused on reaching their goals.
